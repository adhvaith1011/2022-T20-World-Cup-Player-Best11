Jos Buttler,England,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"England have had many players down the ages who have gained world acclaim, but Jos Buttler is arguably their first global Twenty20 superstar. Buttler helped bring England's limited-overs batting into the 21st century, his impact on the one-day and T20 sides extraordinary as they turned a group-stage exit in the 2015 World Cup into a triumph on home soil four years later, with his efforts with the bat and the gloves crucial to their Super-Over victory in the final. In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai. He has also shone at the IPL, and has quickly become a senior player in the Test side since his surprise recall in 2018.",6.0,225.0,156.0,24.0,7.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,45.0,144.23076923076923,61.33333333333333,26.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Alex Hales,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Opening Batter,"Despite a central role in the resurgence of England's limited-overs team following the debacle of the 2015 World Cup, Alex Hales will probably be remembered more for what he missed than what he achieved. He sat out the 2019 World Cup after it emerged he had served a ban for a second drugs test failure for a recreational substance, which seemed to lead the England management and the team's senior players to decide that Hales' behaviour had caused a breakdown of trust between the parties. He was also overlooked for the 2021 T20 World Cup.",6.0,212.0,144.0,19.0,10.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,42.4,147.22222222222223,64.15094339622641,24.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Suryakumar Yadav,India,Right hand Bat,"Right arm Medium, Right arm Offbreak",Batter,"Hard-hitting 360-degree batter Suryakumar Yadav has all the shots, including a few not in any textbook save the one written by AB de Villiers. he also has a yen for making batting look easy, as he showed during four golden years with Mumbai Indians starting in 2018, during which they won the IPL title twice, thanks in no small part to his 1700-plus runs at a strike rate of around 140.",6.0,239.0,126.0,26.0,9.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,59.75,189.68253968253967,66.10878661087865,21.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Glenn Phillips,New Zealand,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Glenn Phillips is a top-order wicketkeeper-batsman who has impressed in white-ball cricket during the early stages of his career. Born in South Africa, he moved to New Zealand with his family at the age of five and has come through the cricket set-up in Auckland. He made his List A debut at the age of 18 before playing in the 2016 Under-19 World Cup. He really started to turn heads, however, during the 2016-17 Super Smash when he was the tournament's leading scorer with 369 runs, including an innings of 116 off 57 balls. He was called into the New Zealand T20 squad to face South Africa in February 2017 after an injury to Martin Guptill.

Virat Kohli,India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Top order Batter,"India has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs.

Curtis Campher,Ireland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"Born in Johannesburg, raised in South Africa and a player for the national Under-19 side, Curtis Campher decided to leave his homeland behind and put his Irish passport to good use in early 2020, declaring his intentions to move to Ireland and play for the national team. He went on the Ireland Wolves' tour to Namibia early that year, and impressed sufficiently to win a place in the squad for a three-match ODI series in England in July.",6.0,126.0,77.0,12.0,2.0,5.0,5.333333333333333,4.0,8.0,48.0,74.0,2.0,17.0,25.2,163.63636363636365,47.61904761904761,12.833333333333334,37.0,9.25,24.0,35.41666666666667
Shadab Khan,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Allrounder,"A prodigious turner of the ball, teenage legspinner Shadab Khan burst onto cricket's collective consciousness only during the 2016/17 PSL season. His ability to take wickets while maintaining an excellent economy rate saw him talked up as that most frequent of phenomena: an exciting Pakistani prospect. Shadab is not afraid of bowling the wrong'un either; his only criticism might be that he bowls it a bit too often, but that hasn't helped batsmen pick it up any better, either out of the hand or off the pitch. He's also a useful lower-order right-handed batsman, something that has occasionally been witnessed during his domestic career.",6.0,98.0,58.0,7.0,5.0,4.0,6.0,7.0,26.0,156.0,165.0,11.0,59.0,24.5,168.9655172413793,59.183673469387756,9.666666666666666,15.0,6.346153846153846,14.181818181818182,37.82051282051282
Sikandar Raza,Zimbabwe,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"Sikandar Raza's story isn't that of your everyday international cricketer.

Sam Curran,England,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"Sam Curran, younger brother of Tom Curran, his fellow Surrey all-rounder, and son of the former Zimbabwe cricketer Kevin Curran, fulfilled his destiny at the age of 19 years and 363 days, when he made his Test debut against Pakistan at Headingley in June 2018. One Test later, he scooped his maiden Man-of-the-Match award, after four first-innings wickets and a thrilling counter-attacking half-century had given England the edge in a gripping Edgbaston Test against India. His success merely heightened the debate as to whether batting or bowling will ultimately become his strongest suit.

Anrich Nortje,South Africa,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Anrich Nortje is a genuine quick who has been described as ""extremely exciting"" by none other than Dale Steyn. Like Steyn, Nortje is not a product of a big city but comes from the town of Uitenhage, north of Port Elizabeth, which is home to the largest Volkswagen factory in the African continent. It's hardly surprising then, that Nortje is well-acquainted with speed. He regularly sends the speed gun over 150kph and has a fearsome bouncer.

Shaheen Shah Afridi,Pakistan,Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast,Bowler,"A baby face perched on a two-metre body, Shaheen Afridi's story is trademark Pakistani. An 18-year old already comfortable in the green shirt of the national side, he's been on the radar of the national selectors for almost three years.
