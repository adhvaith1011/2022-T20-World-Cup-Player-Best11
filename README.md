This project analyzes detailed batting and bowling performance data from the 2022 ICC T20 World Cup to identify the most statistically balanced team. Using Python for data cleaning, aggregation, and performance metric evaluation, the analysis applies filters to shortlist players based on consistency, efficiency, and impact. The final selection ensures a realistic and well-balanced team structure combining top-order stability, middle-order depth, all-round strength, and bowling versatility.
